6.  RADIUS OF CURVATURE OF FINISHED PART SHALL BE WITHIN THE
    TOLERANCE RANGE SPECIFIED.
    WHEN USING A TEST GLASS (NOMINAL WAVELENGTH (MICRONS) =
       A.  TO MEASURE IRREGULARITY, SURFACE OF FINISHED PART SHALL
           FIT TEST GLASS WITHIN 4 TIMES THE IRREGULARITY CALL OUT.
       B.  TO CALCULATE SURFACE RADIUS, INCLUDE FRINGE COUNT
           DEPARTURE FROM MEASURED TEST GLASS RADIUS AND
           UNCERTAINTY OF THE TEST GLASS RADIUS MEASUREMENT.
